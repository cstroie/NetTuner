/**
 * @brief Rotary Encoder Handler Class
 * @details This class manages the rotary encoder hardware for volume control
 * and playlist navigation. It handles both rotation detection and button
 * press events with proper debouncing to ensure reliable operation.
 * 
 * The rotary encoder uses a quadrature encoding scheme where two signals
 * (CLK and DT) change state in a specific sequence depending on the rotation
 *  direction.

   * 
   * The quadrature encoding works as follows:
   * - When rotating clockwise: CLK leads DT
   * - When rotating counter-clockwise: DT leads CLK
   * 
   * Only processes events when CLK transitions from HIGH to LOW to avoid 
   * double-counting.

   * 
   * The button is connected with a pull-up resistor, so a press is detected
   * when the signal transitions from HIGH to LOW (falling edge). However, this
   * function is triggered by an interrupt on the falling edge, so we only need
   * to implement debouncing based on time since last interrupt.
