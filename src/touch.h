 * @brief Touch button class for handling capacitive touch inputs
 * @details This class provides functionality for reading and debouncing
 * capacitive touch buttons on ESP32 touch pins. It supports both polling
 * and interrupt-based operation modes.
 * 
 * The class implements debouncing to prevent multiple detections from
 * a single physical touch due to electrical noise or unstable readings.
 * It can operate in either polling mode (regular state checks) or
 * interrupt mode (hardware interrupt triggered on touch detection).
