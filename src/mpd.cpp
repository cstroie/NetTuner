 * @brief Command registry mapping MPD commands to their handlers

 * - Command name as a string literal
 * - Pointer to the handler function (member function pointer)
 * - Exact match flag (true = exact match, false = prefix match)
 * 
 * The registry is used by the command processing system to efficiently dispatch
 * incoming MPD commands to their appropriate handlers. Commands are matched
 * either exactly (for commands like "stop") or as prefixes (for commands like
 * "play" which should also match "playid").
 * 
 * The registry is sorted alphabetically by command name for readability, though
 * the command processing system does a linear search through all entries.
 * 
 * Adding new commands requires:
 * 1. Adding a handler function declaration in the header file
 * 2. Implementing the handler function
 * 3. Adding an entry to this registry
 * 4. Adding the command to supportedCommands vector if it should appear in "commands" response

 * - Compares with previously stored hashes to detect changes
 * - Sends appropriate MPD notifications when changes occur
 * - Handles noidle command to exit idle mode gracefully

/**
 * @brief Handle MPD commands
 * @details Processes MPD protocol commands with support for MPD protocol version 0.23.0.
 * This function serves as the entry point for command processing, delegating to the
 * registry-based command execution system for efficient dispatch.
 * 
 * The function implements the MPD protocol command processing flow:
 * - Delegates to executeCommand() for registry-based lookup and execution
 * - Maintains compatibility with existing command handling patterns
 * - Ensures proper error handling and response formatting
 * 
 * Command processing follows the MPD protocol specification:
 * - Commands are processed in the order received
 * - Each command receives an appropriate response (OK, list_OK, or error)
 * - State changes are properly tracked and notified to clients
 * 
 * @param command The command string to process

/**
 * @brief Execute command using registry lookup
 * @details Finds and executes the appropriate handler for a given command using
 * a registry-based approach for better organization and maintainability. Commands 
 * are mapped to handler functions using a lookup table for efficient command dispatch.
 * 
 * The function implements command matching with support for both exact and prefix matching:
 * - Exact matching for commands like "stop", "status", etc.
 * - Prefix matching for commands like "play" that need to handle "playid" as well
 * 
 * Command argument extraction is handled automatically based on the matching type:
 * - For exact matches, all remaining text is treated as arguments
 * - For prefix matches, text after the command name (plus space) is treated as arguments
 * 
 * The function implements proper command dispatch following MPD protocol requirements:
 * - Efficient O(n) lookup where n is the number of registered commands
 * - Proper argument parsing and passing to handlers
 * - Standardized error handling for unknown commands
 * - Special handling for empty commands (returns OK)
 * 
 * @param command The command string to execute
 * @return true if command was found and executed, false otherwise
